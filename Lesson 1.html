<h2>Professional Skills</h2> 
<p>Professional Skills and Values: Lessons from University Lecture 
    I covered a wide range of professional skills in the talk, highlighting their importance as nontechnical, interpersonal abilities necessary for success in the workplace. These abilities, which 
    go beyond technical knowledge and make people well-rounded and useful contributors to any 
    professional context, are frequently referred to as soft skills or employability skills.
    Definition of Employability Skills: 
    Employability skills also referred to as soft or transferable skills—explained in the presentation 
    that go beyond technical knowledge to include attributes that companies value. 
    Communication, cooperation, problem-solving, flexibility, time management, and leadership 
    are a few examples.
    Skills Necessary for Employment: 
    • Communication Skills: Using a variety of channels to successfully convey information.
    • Critical thinking and problem-solving abilities: Evaluating data and creating workable 
    answers.
    • Collaboration and teamwork: Collaborating well with others to accomplish shared 
    objectives.
    • Flexibility and adaptability: Accepting change and making adjustments for various 
    circumstances.
    • Time management: It is the art of setting priorities and arranging work effectively to 
    fulfill deadlines.
    • Leadership: It is directing and inspiring others to work toward a common objective.
     
    Classifying Workplace Skills: 
    The lecture categorized workplace skills into three parts.
    1. technical skills (job-specific knowledge) 
    2. soft skills (interpersonal and communication skills) 
    3. transferable skills (versatile skills applicable across roles and industries).</p>
